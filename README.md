# Psychology-RAG-Fusion

This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) fusion application that leverages the Handbook of Psychology: Volume 1, History of Psychology by Donald K. Freedheim and Irving B. Weiner. The application utilizes LangChain, LLaMA3 70B model, and Pinecone vector database to provide detailed insights and answers about the history of psychology.

## Overview
The Psychology RAG Fusion application combines the power of language models and vector databases to enhance the retrieval and generation of information related to the history of psychology. By using the LangChain framework and LLaMA3 70B model, alongside the Pinecone vector store, this application offers efficient and accurate responses based on the contents of the specified handbook.

## Features
- Advanced Language Model: Utilizes the LLaMA3 70B model for generating detailed and contextually relevant answers.
- Scalable Vector Database: Pinecone vector database ensures fast and scalable search operations.
- Rich Content: Based on the Handbook of Psychology: Volume 1, History of Psychology, providing a comprehensive source of knowledge.
